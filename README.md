# AzureDataLakeTour
Exploration of the a data lake setting up and use on Azure cloud

## Main tips
Basically, this repo is not intended to be reused by anyone except me.
However, if ever you want to use it for your own.
1. Before running this repo, make sure you get an azure account and sign in to it using your credentials.
2. Check `terraform.tfvars` file to customize resource names.
    * If ever you want to customize deeper then feel free to explore and change the `2_main.tf` file content.
3. Two additional script are offered in `DataLakeDeployment` directory.
    * `.terraformDestroyAll.sh` : To perform recursive destroy so that files being stored in the containers do not stop destroy process (See description in the script).
    * `.reset.sh` : To be executed to remove all files that are automatically generated by terraforms. Hence the script's name...<br>
    (Caution: To be executed only after a terraform destroy call.)

## Resources location
A directory called 'Resources' is on the project root
